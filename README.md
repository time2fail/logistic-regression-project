# Logistic Regression Project

This repository contains a logistic regression project implemented in Python.  
The goal is to explore data, visualize relationships, and build a simple logistic regression model to make predictions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the dataset.
- Visualize distributions (histograms, bar plots, heatmaps).
- Preprocess the dataset (handle categorical/numerical features).
- Train a **logistic regression model**.
- Evaluate the model with accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was provided as part of a Udemy course for educational purposes.  
⚠️ For this reason, the raw dataset file is **not included in this repository**.  

If you are following along with the same course, you should already have access to the dataset.  
Otherwise, you can replace it with any dataset that has similar structure (categorical + numerical features suitable for classification).

## 📊 Visualizations
Some of the visualizations included:
- Histogram of age distribution
- Gender distribution (with percentage labels)
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features
- Model performance metrics
